# Spring Security

why spring security? 

Application security is not fun and its challenging to implement with our custom code

Spring Security built by a team at Spring who are good at security scenarios.  Using Spring security we can secure web apps
with minimum configurations. So there is no need to re-invent the wheel here

Spring security handles common security vulnerabilities like CSRF, CORS etc. For any security vulnerabilities identified, the framework will be patched immediately as it is being used by many organizations

It helps us secure our pages/API paths, enforce roles, method level security etc with minimum configurations

It supports various standards of security to implement authentication, like using username/password authentication, JWT tokens, OAuth2, OpenID
